# Iris Flower Classification

This project involves developing a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset used is the classic Iris dataset, which includes measurements for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Project Objectives

1. **Develop a Classification Model**: Build a model to accurately classify Iris flowers into three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.
2. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
3. **Feature Importance**: Identify the most significant features influencing the classification.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which is included in the `IRIS.csv` file. It contains 150 samples with the following features:
- `sepal_length`
- `sepal_width`
- `petal_length`
- `petal_width`
- `species` (target variable)

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Usage
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

BASH

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the Project Directory: Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:

BASH

cd your-repo-name
Run the Script: Execute the Python script to train and evaluate the model:

BASH

python iris_classification.py
Results
The model's performance is evaluated using a classification report and a confusion matrix. These metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model used in this project achieves high accuracy in classifying the Iris species.

Accuracy: The overall accuracy of the model.
Precision: The precision for each class.
Recall: The recall for each class.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Visualization
The project includes several visualizations to help understand the data and the model's performance:

Pair Plot: Visualizes the relationships between features and the distribution of species.
Box Plot: Shows the distribution of each feature.
Heatmap: Displays the correlation matrix to identify significant features.
These visualizations are generated using seaborn and matplotlib and provide a comprehensive view of the dataset and feature interactions.

Feature Importance
The correlation matrix heatmap helps identify which features are most influential in classifying the species. Typically, petal length and petal width are found to be significant predictors.
