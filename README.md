# Iris Flower Classification

This project involves developing a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset used is the classic Iris dataset, which includes measurements for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Project Objectives

1. **Develop a Classification Model**: Build a model to accurately classify Iris flowers into three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.
2. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
3. **Feature Importance**: Identify the most significant features influencing the classification.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which is included in the `IRIS.csv` file. It contains 150 samples with the following features:
- `sepal_length`
- `sepal_width`
- `petal_length`
- `petal_width`
- `species` (target variable)

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:
